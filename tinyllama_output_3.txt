The lichen Laetipornea cylindrica is often referred to as the "Lace Plant", the name being derived from its fibres resembling those of lace. Lace plants belong to the class Asteraceae (lily family) and grow on stones, boulders and vertical cliffs. They form symbiotic relationships with two types of organisms called moulds and spores. One mould, Microspora meadowsi, has been shown to produce polysaccharides (carbohydrates), which are thought to contribute to the adhesion and survival of Lace Plants on their substrates.
Lace plants have a very complex life cycle which involves two main stages. In the first stage they germinate from tiny seed masses which enter the upper layer of their substrate. In this way these seed masses act as the medium through which the fungus can thrive. This part of the process is also where the relationship between the fungus and the plant is made. The second stage is when the mature lichen begins to develop. It does so by creating specialised structures called hyphae. These grow downwards into the substrate, where they join together forming filaments known as mycelium, at which point the Lace Plant undergoes an autophagy-like process, causing it to die. Autophagy is a natural process whereby cells break down macromolecules inside themselves. The Lace Plant has an enzyme called Atg7, which is thought to be involved in autophagy. Although there are many other species of lichen, including those which do not follow this pathway, the Lace Plant is thought to be unique for having a significant level of attenuation after this pathway, as opposed to the relatively normal responses of most other lichens.
In this activity you will learn about the use of chemicals in biology by testing the hypothesis that different compounds used as insecticides could have harmful effects on lichen leaves after their death, especially in the case of the Lace Plant.
After some preparations, I placed 30 ml of distilled water (approximately 31°C) into two 250 ml micro-centrifuge tubes. I then added three different insecticides at different concentration: carbofuran (100 g/L); chlorphenicol (10 g/L) and metam Pyrethroid (60 g/L). I shaken each tube at room temperature for 30 min until completely dissolved, and then I filtered the solution through a 0.45μm filter paper. After the filtering step the resulting supernatant was kept for further analysis.
To avoid contamination of the samples by soil, I placed them on top of a clean microfibre cloth (Nyquist, NP138M). To prevent the presence of residues of insecticides on the microfibre, I had previously pre-soaked the cloth in methanol for a few minutes, ensuring that there were no pores or gaps present. To clean the microfibre after each use, I put it in the dishwasher and left it to cycle for about 10 min at 40°C, before laying it flat on a bed of synthetic Carpillot to remove any residue.
Suspend an equal volume of the filtered solutions from the air using a silicone syringe, adding enough water to fill the suspension volume to a depth of 2-3 mm below the surface of the suspension. Subsequently to prevent the formation of aggregates (which would result in a decrease in activity of the insecticide), I filtered the suspension once every 20 s and removed all sediment by centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min). Then I transferred the suspensions (in sterile polyvinylpyrrolidone tubes) to a new set of sterile polyvinylpyrrolidone tubes (50 ml capacity) and filled them up to the same depth.
The results of the study show that a combination of carbofuran, chlorphenicol and metam pyrethroid significantly reduces leaf area compared to controls without injuring the plant; but in addition to these, carbon dioxide is reduced (autophagy) leading to cell death of the lichen. These results suggest that the chemicals used as insecticides to control lichen may lead to harmful effects on the plant during the process of dying, through a decrease in the abundance of certain microorganisms. Further investigation of this hypothesis is needed.

Ok, good job! In this section, you should respond with a different sentence if you were a doctor. The response should describe the next step in your diagnostic process based on what you have learned from the previous paragraph.
Ok, so you think it's water-induced urticaria, I will order a blood test for IgG4-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and complete blood count. Next, I will check your pulse rate, respiration rate, pupillary function, and EKG. We may need a urine test as well depending on what we find there. Please note that the presence of IgG4 is not evidence of an allergic reaction and usually occurs with some medical conditions.
I am Dr. Finkelstein. Based on the information you provided me, I suspect that you have water-induced urticaria, a serious condition that can cause painful rashes, hives, itchiness, and swelling. You also reported feeling dizzy and faint while in the shower, which suggests a possible allergic reaction. Blood tests, pulse rate, respiration rate, eye movements, and EKG are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Please remain calm and relax for the urine test.

There are many pros and cons to both methods, which are determined by your surgeon based on the type of anatomy, size of tumor, experience and expertise with your specific surgery, as well as your previous medical history. It is generally recommended that patients opt for laparoscopic esophagectomy. There are multiple advantages compared to traditional open esophagectomy:
1. Surgical approach: With laparoscopy, the entire esophagus is viewed through tiny incisions at each site in the abdomen. This minimizes bleeding and scarring from traditional open procedures. Laparoscopy also helps with visualization of soft tissues, nerves and other vital structures.
2. Improved access: A port can be created under the chin for a simple incision, reducing the amount of scarring and postoperative pain. During the procedure, a small incision is made above the belly button on either side of the neck. The cancerous tissue is removed through this incision.
3. Fewer blood vessels cut off: While open surgeries remove part of the esophagus, laparoscopic procedures do not involve cutting off the remaining part. This avoids damaging critical nerves and other vital structures. The cancerous tissue can be removed without disturbing nerves and blood vessels.
4. Better outcomes: Most importantly, long-term outcomes are generally similar between the two procedures, according to published studies. Studies indicate that a laparoscopic approach offers better outcomes than traditional open approaches for certain esophageal cancers that would be too dangerous for surgery. For example, less blood supply is available to the cancer, so the cancer may have more challenges growing and spreading. Also, shorter and easier access to the esophagus is possible, which makes it easier for surgeons to see and treat the disease.
5. Lighter recovery: Some patients have difficulty returning to their normal activities because of excessive vomiting, dizziness and discomfort after the esophagectomy. However, laparoscopic esophagectomy is a simpler procedure with a smaller incision, which allows for quicker recoveries without significant discomfort.
6. Less scarring: Scarring from traditional open esophagectomies can also leave a significant scar on the chest or abdomen. In some cases, scar revision surgery can be done before the esophagectomy to reduce or eliminate the scar.
7. Pain control: With laparoscopy, there's minimal bleeding or scarring, making for a faster and easier recovery. Patients only need pain medication, and recovery time is often shorter than traditional open procedures.
With these advantages, laparoscopic esophagectomies offer a better option compared to traditional open esophagectomies in terms of recovery time, reduction of scarring, better long-term outcomes and shorter length of hospital stays.
The surgeon will decide based on your individual medical condition whether you should undergo either laparoscopic or open esophagectomy. If you have any questions about your particular situation, please do not hesitate to consult with a healthcare professional about your options. Good luck!
In summary the main points of the articles
If I were you I would carefully review the following statements:
Laparoscopic (keyhole) esophagectomy is a simpler procedure with a smaller incision
It may cause less bleeding and scarring
Bleeding does occur but rarely can be dangerous or life threatening
Therefore if you believe the risks, benefits and alternatives clearly outweigh the potential benefits then go for the surgical technique. You can ask your doctor about this further and they will advise you.
Esophagectomy is where part of the esophagus is removed due to cancer or another problem
Open esophagectomy is where the entire esophagus is removed
Your cancer needs to be too large to remove through the traditional laparoscope
You should want to remove the portion of esophagus to allow a flow of air and food freely
There are 2 ways to do it
Bypassing the esophagus is the easy option that involves making a cut along the curve of the neck just above the neck muscles. It is easier but doesn't always guarantee success
The less invasive and less familiar alternative is a hiatal hernia repair that starts just below your heart to sew the diaphragm around the opening of your windpipe.

It seems like something I would enjoy doing! Doing research sounds fun and educational. The chance to help others seems fulfilling. I would be willing to be involved in future studies like this but only after sufficient safety and effectiveness data has been obtained. It might not be practical to participate at the moment. Don't feel pressured - research is important for a healthy society!
The study includes both descriptive and analytical forms of responses. As the descriptive form asks respondents questions relating to their experience, there is no right/no response category. Therefore, only answering "Yes" or "No" is possible. Any other response (e.g. "Maybe", "I don't know") will result in the weighted mean of all the responses given for that question being added together and expressed as a percentage.
There are several advantages to conducting this kind of study involving non-consensual participants. However, even in cases where these limitations are recognised, there remains a need for such studies to ensure that the outcomes of interest are not influenced by attitudes towards participants' willingness to give their time for research. Thus, the 'yes/no' type of response structure used in this study could potentially provide insights into people's attitudes and beliefs regarding biomedical research, including potential for potential benefits or harms of research participation. The study design itself does not make any direct claims about the nature of the information provided or the underlying data being used for analysis, which means that researchers should exercise caution when interpreting the results if they are considering using such a study for their own purposes.
